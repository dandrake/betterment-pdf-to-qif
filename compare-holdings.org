* Workflow for comparing Moneydance holdings and Betterment statements

For now -- [2023-07-01 Sat] -- here's a not-too-annoying way to compare
holdings and make sure they match up.

1. Run [[file:compare-holdings.py::"""The ultimate goal here is to export data from Moneydance, then parse the][compare-holdings.py]] with a debug flag and dump the output into a
   CSV:

   #+begin_src shell
     python compare-holdings.py --betterment betterment-statement.pdf-debug.txt --debug > foo.csv
   #+end_src

2. That gives Betterment holdings in something Gnumeric can use.

3. In Moneydance, go to the Portfolio report, set the Betterment accounts and a date,
   and click Save to output the CSV.

4. Now you can copy and paste, do a formula for the difference, and so on.
